  <p>These lessons are a highly organized and well-indexed set of lessons in the Java
programming language. NetBeans, a specific IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) is used throughout the lessons. Lessons are written for the
beginner to initiated programmer: the high school, college or university student
seeking to advance their computer science repertoire on their own, or the
enlightened professional who wishes to embark on Java coding for the first time.
Skilled programmers and beginners alike benefit from the style of presentation.
While full solutions are provided, practical projects are presented in an easy-to-
follow set of lessons explaining the rational for the solution - the form layout,
coding design and conventions, and specific code related to the problem. The
learner may follow the tutorials at their own pace while focusing upon context
relevant information.
The finished product is the reward, but the learner is fully engaged and enriched
by the process. This kind of learning is often the focus of teacher training at the
highest level. Every Computer Science teacher and self-taught learner knows
what a great deal of work is required for projects to work in this manner, and
with these tutorials, the work is done by an author who understands</p>
